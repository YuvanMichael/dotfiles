# To get my setup, run setup.sh which will get ml4w's dotfiles installed. And then, from the file manager, copy paste my dotfiles. Present in this repo. 
# For wallpapers, if not configured by default, launch waypaper from either rofi / terminal and change wallpaper folder to dotfiles/wallpapers in this repo. 

# Stay tuned for more improvements!

# TODO
## 1. More refinements (Make the desktop more usable and coherent, concise, better and configured as a "all in one" that just works.) And turn it into its own new thing. Different from ML4W and turn it into my own dotfiles. 
## 2. Make a new install script created from the ground up. That doesn't require user attention. (Only sudo passwords probably!*) * for package installations. 

An advanced configuration of Hyprland for Arch Linux based distributions. This package includes an installation script to install and setup the required components.

These dotfiles are available to clone, use personally or professionally. I don't care, make your linux rig as good as you want it to be. Probably would like my name in credits. (Not required.) (Just to keep me motivated on this project)

## Installation

The installation should work on all Arch Linux based distributions. (NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK ON ARCH LINUX DERIVATIVES) * ONLY VANILLA ARCH. 

The easiest way is to use the setup.sh script. The script will download all files from Github and start the installation automatically.

Just copy/enter the following command into your terminal.

```
bash <(curl -s https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles/-/raw/main/setup.sh)
```

### Caution when getting keyboard layout selected, you may get German keyboard layout like I did the first time I tried this. Please reconfigure your keyboard in the script and proceed during installation. 

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution, setup and personal configuration can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the ML4W Dotfiles will work everywhere. Installation at your own risk.

## Wallpapers

All wallpapers that I use are provided in the "wallpapers" directory of this repo. 

## Thanks to
### ML4W (Stephan Raabe) for his dotfiles and his great service to linux customization. And to everyone else who helped him.
