# Important notice, this setup is now in maintainance mode. 
* I have switched over to HyDE dotfiles which look quite good. I usually make dotfile changes like these every once a while. I'll maintain seperate branches like this.
* The plan right now is to make an all in one dotfiles thing that I like. Having the best of both worlds. That's what I do!
* If I come across more dotfiles that I think will be a good addition. I'll keep updating.
* My own customizations made in seperate rices will be kept in maintainence mode.
* Like ML4W, there are other dotfiles that are probably bound to end up in maintainance mode.
* These "maintainence mode" things are usually stuff that I don't use anymore, but would like to keep updated. And probably switch to these every once a while when I get bored. These will typically be kept sure to work with the most recent versions as of now. I would encourage reporting issues and would love to get it fixed asap.
* I'm looking at some VM options and bare metal ones to maintain and check multiple versions of these dotfiles on seperate Arch installations. As an "all in one" like I tried likes to get stuff confusing. You can see the mess in the new "dev" branch. Anyways Stay Tuned!
* Some of the dotfiles I'm lookin' at,
* ML4W
* HyDE
* sane 1090x
* The Linux Cast
* Others will be added when I come across them. 
# To get my setup, run setup.sh which will get ml4w's dotfiles installed. And then, from the file manager, copy paste my dotfiles. Present in this repo. 
# For wallpapers, if not configured by default, launch waypaper from either rofi / terminal and change wallpaper folder to dotfiles/wallpapers in this repo. 

# Have a terminal ready to make all scripts in dotfiles executable. again, install script will be created soon.

# Required for you to install hyprexpo and hyprtrails as well (install script will be created soon to automate this.)

# Stay tuned for more improvements!

# TODO
## 1. More refinements (Make the desktop more usable and coherent, concise, better and configured as a "all in one" that just works.) And turn it into its own new thing. Different from ML4W and turn it into my own dotfiles. 
## 2. Make a new install script created from the ground up. That doesn't require user attention. (Only sudo passwords probably!*) * for package installations. 

An advanced configuration of Hyprland for Arch Linux based distributions. This package includes an installation script to install and setup the required components.

#### The images below are slightly outdated. But should give a rough idea of how they look. 
#### The images are of ml4w's dotfiles. Mine are slightly different
#### I'll update the images once I think I'm ready to showcase my fully customized product.

These dotfiles are available to clone, use personally or professionally. I don't care, make your linux rig as good as you want it to be. Probably would like my name in credits. (Not required.) (Just to keep me motivated on this project)

## Installation

The installation should work on all Arch Linux based distributions. (NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK ON ARCH LINUX DERIVATIVES) * ONLY VANILLA ARCH. 

The easiest way is to use the setup.sh script. The script will download all files from Github and start the installation automatically.

Just copy/enter the following command into your terminal.

```
bash <(curl -s https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles/-/raw/main/setup.sh)
```

### Caution when getting keyboard layout selected, you may get German keyboard layout like I did the first time I tried this. Please reconfigure your keyboard in the script and proceed during installation. 

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution, setup and personal configuration can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the ML4W Dotfiles will work everywhere. Installation at your own risk.

## Wallpapers

All wallpapers that I use are provided in the "wallpapers" directory of this repo. 

## Thanks to
### ML4W (Stephan Raabe) for his dotfiles and his great service to linux customization. And to everyone else who helped him.
