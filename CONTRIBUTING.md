I don't really care about this all that much but,
# Here's what I expect and want you to expect. 
### 1. The contribution should be useful. Whatever it may be. 
### 2. This is only a backup for my personal dotfiles. These are what I use. I will only accept pull requests if I feel they don't impact my environment. If they do, there will be a seperate branch created for these kinds of things and if possible, slowly merged into the main branch. Any bugs, breaking changes etc shall be fixed in available times and pretty much asap. Either by me (or) with the help of contributors. 
### 3. Frequent updates are usually made, expect your code to change somehow, someday. Probably in new features and such.
### 4. I cannot guarantee that these configs will work. As far as I know, they will be made sure to work only on Arch Linux and their derivatives. *
* Unless in distributions like Garuda Linux where so many custom things are done that they break stuff.
